# Welcome to **ML-Projects-Hub**! üöÄ

This repository serves as a centralized hub for various **Machine Learning projects**, each focusing on different domains such as **image classification, sound recognition, natural language processing, and more**. It allows developers, researchers, and ML enthusiasts to explore, contribute, and experiment with machine learning models.

## Repository Structure
The repository follows a modular structure using **Git submodules** to link multiple ML projects:
```
ML-Projects-Hub/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Speech-Digit-Classification/      (linked submodule)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Tweet-Sentimentp-Classification/  (linked submodule)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ...                               (linked submodule)
```
Each submodule represents an **independent ML project** hosted in a separate repository.

## Purpose of This Repository
‚úÖ Organize multiple **Machine Learning projects** in one hub.  
‚úÖ Maintain modularity by keeping projects as **separate repositories**.  
‚úÖ Enable **easy cloning, updates, and contributions** for all linked projects.  
‚úÖ Serve as a learning resource for **ML enthusiasts and researchers**.
